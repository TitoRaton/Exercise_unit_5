# Exercise_unit_5
Repository created for development environments, IES San Vicente


In this exercise you are going to work with your Git repository in order to maintain updated some
files.
1. Create a new, public repository called Exercise_unit_5
2. You will be provided with some files that you have to upload to your repository. 
3. You will modify one of these files and upload the changes to your repository with the 
message “Commit for step 3”. For example, you can add a new line or modify an existing 
one. In order to upload the changes, you can either use GitKraken, Visual Studio Code or the 
command line if you prefer, using the appropriate Git actions in each case.
4. You will add a new file (a .txt for example) to your repository, and upload the changes in the 
same way that you did in step 3, with the message “Commit for step 4”.
5. You will modify another file and upload the changes to your repository using this time the 
console commands of Git to upload this file modified. The message must be “Commit for 
step 5”.
6. You will add another file and upload it to your repository using this time the console 
commands of Git to upload this new file. This message must be “Commit for step 6”.
7. You will provide the link of your repository in this task delivery, so that we will be able to 
see the result of your work and the commits performed.

repository in steps 5 and 6.
